            <h3 className="text-xl">7. Assumption of Risk</h3>

            <p>
              By accessing and using the Service, you represent that you
              understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic
              and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working
              knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Virtual Assets. You
              further understand that the markets for these Virtual Assets are
              highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to)
              adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You
              acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with
              cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as the Applicable
              Network are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.
              You further acknowledge the risk that your Virtual Assets may lose
              some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Service.
              Use of the Protocol involves the use of the Applicable Network,
              which may require that you pay Gas Charges, as described Section
              2.2. above. You acknowledge and agree that we have no control
              over: (a) any Applicable Network transactions; (b) the method of
              payment of any Gas Charges; or (c) any actual payments of Gas
              Charges. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient
              balance of Applicable Network Tokens stored at your Wallet Address
              to complete any transaction on the Applicable Network before
              initiating such Applicable Network transaction. You represent and
              warrant that you have the knowledge, experience, understanding,
              professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of
              the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements under
              Applicable Law of engaging in transactions through the Service.
              You acknowledge and understand that the Protocol allocates your
              Virtual Assets to third-party decentralized web protocols for
              various purposes and that we are not responsible or liable for
              these transactions or the operation of these third-party
              protocols. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for
              any of these variables or risks and cannot be held liable for any
              resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the
              Protocol or the Service. You further acknowledge that you are
              solely responsible for determining whether any transaction placed
              through the Protocol, is appropriate, suitable, adapted to your
              financial situation, personal objectives, financial circumstances,
              and risk tolerance. You should consult a legal, financial or tax
              professional regarding your specific situation before engaging in
              any transaction through the Protocol . We are not responsible for
              the operation of the Protocol or any underlying Smart Contracts
              which the Protocol links to, and we make no guarantee of their
              functionality, security, or availability. Accordingly, you
              understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the
              risks of accessing and using the Service and interacting with the
              Protocol.

            <h3 className="text-xl">8. Third-Party Resources and Promotions</h3>
            <p>
              The Protocol may contain references or links to third-party
              resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials,
              products, or services, that we do not own or control. In addition,

              of the Protocol or Service. We do not endorse or assume any
              responsibility for any such resources or promotions. If you access
              any such resources or participate in any such promotions, you do
              so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement does
              not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third
              parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising
              from your use of any such resources or participation in any such
              promotions. You acknowledge that the Service links to certain
              open-source components and that your use of the Protocol and the
              Service is subject to, and you will comply with any, applicable
              open-source licenses that govern any such open-source components
              (collectively, “Open-Source Licenses”). Without limiting the
              generality of the foregoing, you may not: (a) resell, lease, lend,
              share, distribute or otherwise permit any third party to use the
              Protocol; (b) use the Protocol for time-sharing or service bureau
              purposes; or (c) otherwise use the Protocol or Service in a manner
              that violates any license hereunder.
