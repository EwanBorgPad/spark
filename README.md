# ⚡ Spark-It

> **Fuel the casino. Fund the future.**

Spark turns every idea into a token. Trading fees go into a dedicated DAO. Token holders vote on how the funds are used to bring the idea to life.

## 🎯 TL;DR — What is Spark?

Spark is a revolutionary platform that transforms ideas into tradable tokens with built-in governance. Here's how it works:

1. **Anyone posts an idea** on Twitter by tagging the official Spark account
2. **Spark automatically creates a token** for that idea using Meteora DBC (Dynamic Bonding Curve)
3. **The token trades in permissionless pools** with dynamic bonding curves
4. **Trading fees are split**: 50% to the idea's DAO treasury, 50% to Spark DAO
5. **Token holders vote** on how to use the treasury to build the idea using Realms DAO governance
6. **The more belief + trading, the bigger the treasury** — and the higher chance the idea gets built

## 🧩 The Problem — Why Spark?

Today's innovation landscape is broken:

- **Great ideas die quietly** — posted on Twitter, shared in DMs, pitched at hackathons, but most never get funding
- **No way to bet on ideas early** without a full team, product, or roadmap
- **Speculation dominates crypto** but rarely builds anything useful
- **Communities want to contribute** but have no way to align money with intention at the idea stage
- **Most funding models only empower the builder** — once they get money or sell tokens, they're no longer incentivized to deliver

### Spark changes that.

- **Tokenizing ideas** gives people a way to support them instantly
- **Trading volume = fuel** — the more interest and trading, the more the DAO earns
- **Holders = decision-makers** — they vote how funds are used, making the vision a shared mission

## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. Idea Submission
Anyone can submit an idea by tagging the official Spark account on Twitter. The platform automatically detects and processes these submissions.

### 2. Token Creation
Spark automatically creates an SPL token for each idea using the **Meteora Stack**:
- **Meteora DBC (Dynamic Bonding Curve)** for initial token launch and fair price discovery
- **DAMM v2** when the token graduates to more advanced trading
- **Permissionless trading** on Meteora DEX
- **Built-in governance** through Realms DAO

### 3. Trading & Fee Collection
- **2% trading fees** are collected on every transaction
- **Fee split**: 50% to the idea's DAO treasury, 50% to Spark DAO
- **Real-time market data** from Jupiter, DexScreener, and Birdeye

### 4. DAO Governance with Realms
Once a project "graduates" (reaches certain milestones), a dedicated **Realms DAO** is created where token holders can:
- **Vote on proposals** for how to use the treasury using Realms governance stack
- **Fund builders and developers** through application system
- **Support marketing and community growth**
- **Reward contributors**
- **Burn tokens** to reduce supply

### 5. Builder Marketplace
- **Developers can apply** to build specific proposals
- **GitHub integration** for reputation and skill verification
- **Transparent pricing** and project scope
- **Community voting** on builder selection using Realms voting system

## 📱 Application Flow

### Complete User Journey
1. **Create a token with an idea on X (Twitter)** - Users post ideas by tagging the official Spark account
2. **Token appears on Spark app** - The platform automatically creates a token using Meteora DBC
3. **Connect using Privy** - Users authenticate with their wallet through Privy integration
4. **Receive and send tokens** - Users can transfer tokens to other users
5. **Buy tokens with Jupiter** - Integrated Jupiter stack allows seamless token purchases for newly created tokens
6. **Developer proposals** - Developers can create proposals to build specific features or improvements
7. **Token-based voting** - Users vote on proposals using their tokens through the Realms governance system

## 🌐 Who Is It For?

### 🚀 **Dreamers**
People with bold ideas but no funding. Spark gives you a platform to share your vision and get community backing.

### 🎰 **Degens** 
Who want to speculate, but **on creation**. Trade tokens representing real ideas and participate in their success.

### 👷 **Builders**
Looking for a signal to build what people actually want. The marketplace connects you with funded projects and communities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend
- **React + TypeScript** with modern UI/UX
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Privy** for wallet authentication
- **Jupiter SDK** for token swaps
- **Real-time data** from multiple sources

### Backend
- **Cloudflare Pages Functions** for serverless APIs
- **D1 Database** for data persistence
- **Solana Web3.js** for blockchain interactions
- **Meteora SDK** for DEX operations and DBC
- **Realms SDK** for DAO governance

### Smart Contracts
- **Anchor Framework** for Solana programs
- **SPL Token** for token creation
- **Realms Governance** for DAO functionality
- **Meteora DBC** for dynamic bonding curves
- **DAMM v2** for advanced trading when tokens graduate

### Mobile App
- **Android APK** created by converting the PWA to an Android app using [Solana Mobile's TWA (Trusted Web Activity) approach](https://docs.solanamobile.com/dapp-publishing/publishing-a-pwa)
- **Bubblewrap CLI** used to package the PWA into a native Android experience
- **Not yet published to dApp Store** - currently in development/testing phase
